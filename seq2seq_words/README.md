# Sequence to Sequence Model with Characters encoding 

## What it is ?
- Sequence to sequence is a very general framework based on Encoder-Decoder Architecture. In order to train the 
model we  need to provide a pair of sequences - one for input and one for output. 
- The fundamental meaningful units of text are words and not the charaters but the code provided here considers
input and output sequences made of characters and so we do not expect any satisafctory outcomes.
- This model is just a  template on which we can build a realistic model after making minor changes.
